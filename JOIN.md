# How to join/become involved
***
### Attend a meeting
Meetings are officially on Fridays from 12:00am to 3:00pm in the SRJC Library. Since meeting times are subject to change, check out our slack for up to date meeting times.

### Slack

Slack is our way of communicating, sharing and posting information professionally. Since Slack is divided up into channels, we require all of our members to help pass around critial information on this service in the appropriate channel( we also have a channel named random :wink: ). And with everyone on the same service, we can quickly share documents and links vs looking through threads of emails. **Before inviting you to any of our other services, like Checkvist and GitHub, we require you to accept the invite to slack first.**

### Discord

We use Discord for several areas that Slack setup can't provide. Discord offers us free unlimited storage and audio and video calls. We highly recommend checking it out as well.
